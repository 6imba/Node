# JavaScript Executing Flow:
    - Vanilla JS is used to built apps that runs inside our browser.
    - So every browser out there has what we call JS-Engine that takes JS-code and convert it into Machine-code.
    - Some of JS Engine used by avialable browsers ==> Microsoft Edge(Chakra), Mozilla Firefox(Spider Monkey), Chrome(V8). ==> V8 is fastest one.
    - Because of variation in JS-Engine same JS code may behave differently in different browser.
    - Therefore, browser provides runtime environment for JavaScript code.
        - (For example: In browser we have -window and -document object that provides environment to run JS code)

# Simply, browser provides runtime environment to run JavaScript code on client-side.
    - In constrast,
# Node provides runtime environment to run JavaScript code on server-side(outsdie browser).
