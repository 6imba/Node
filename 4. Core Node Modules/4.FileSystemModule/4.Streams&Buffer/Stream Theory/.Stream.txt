# HugeFile(source) --> Download(take more time) --> Process(watch) ===> PlayBack
# HugeFile(source) --> chop that massive data into pieces(buffer_chunk) --> Stream(chunk of buffer data) --> buffer_chunk gets stored in buffer memory of destination device --> buffer chunk is passed for Processing(watch) when buffer storage in destination gets full.

# HugeFile(source):
    - video file,
    - audio file,
    - text file,
