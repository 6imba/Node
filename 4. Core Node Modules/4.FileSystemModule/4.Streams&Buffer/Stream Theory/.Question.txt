- What when buffer memory gets full, then only buffer_chunk_data is passed on for processing.
- What when buffer memory gets full?
- what is the size of individual/per chunk?
- is buffer_storage_size different for different application(youtube,messenger).



- we can create a streams to read and write files in node.js
- because the way buffer's stream work, our application performance increases.(request on node server)



# Data handling ==> stream buffer: memory&time efficiency

# Sources -> Stream data(vedio>break_into_small_piece_data(buffer_chunk))
