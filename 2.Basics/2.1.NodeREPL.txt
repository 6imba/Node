- REPL (READ, EVAL, PRINT, LOOP) is a computer environment similar to Shell (Unix/Linux) and command prompt.
- Node comes with the REPL environment when it is installed.
- System interacts with the user through outputs of commands/expressions used.
- It is useful in writing and debugging the codes.
- Therefore, REPL feature of Node.js is very useful in experimenting with Node.js codes and to debug JavaScript codes.

- Inorder to #experiment_Node.js_code & #debug_JavaScipt_code, we need to enter into Node REPL.
- So to enter into Node REPL ==> terminal command: node

- (To exit, press Ctrl+C again or Ctrl+D or type .exit)

- Double tab inside Node REPL will output all Node properties,methods,object,class,module.

- type of name of the any Node properties,methods,object to see the its properties and methods if exist.
